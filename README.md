*Like most, you probably believe that nothing exists outside of this world you play in.*

*And yet, there are countless other worlds.*

*You can see them sparkle brilliantly in the Archipelago.*

*Through that sea of games, plando will guide your slot to where you are meant to be.*

*However, if you arrive in a world that's neither gomode nor BK'd, but somewhere on the other side, your goal will be far from easy.*

*If that happens, you must abandon your syncâ€”we have failed.*
