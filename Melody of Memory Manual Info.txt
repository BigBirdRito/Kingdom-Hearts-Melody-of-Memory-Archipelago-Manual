Goal:

For this game your goal is to collect Stars! The amount required is configurable as a yaml option! While the victory location is named after the ending of World Tour, it's up to you whether you want to play it!

Mechanics:

This manual is intended to be used with a save file that has all 150 songs unlocked! High-level Teams, Maxed out Collector's Bonuses, and plenty of Potions, Mega-Potions, & Summoning Stars will be a huge boon to you but are not required!

Each song has three locations tied to it! One location for the song, another for an item, and the final for a star! If you don't want songs to be locked, then you can get rid of those items/locations! If you don't want items to be limited, you can get rid of those too! And as mentioned previously the same goes for Stars as well!

If you do keep all three locations, here are some suggestions for how to go about checking them! You could check:

All three at once
One per time played
One per Difficulty
One per Mission (For World Tour songs!)
One per Style

Once you've received all of a specific item, you may freely use as many extra ones as you'd like for the remainder of your playthrough! Each item has 50 copies of it in the apworld by default!

Customization:

This manual features yaml options that allow you to customize your expereince! Simply swap the 0 and 50 with each other and you're good to go!
